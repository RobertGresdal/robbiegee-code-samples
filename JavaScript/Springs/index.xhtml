<h1>Springs</h1>

<p>I'm trying to recreate a java applet I wrote for a school submission that were supposed to animate a ball suspended on a string. I created a spring system where one could fling the ball around. It could have been a fun game had I added some logic to it.

<canvas id="c" width="480" height="320" style="border:1px solid black"></canvas>

<input id="output1"/><input id="output2"/>

<script type="text/javascript">
window.onload = function(){
	c = document.getElementById('c');

	mc = new MouseCursor(c);

	//r = new Spring('Foo', 20); //give render canvas and set to 20 fps
	g = new Gravity();
	
	b1 = new Ball(120,20,5);
	b2 = new Ball(80,60,10);
	
	s1 = new Spring(mc,b1,50,5,1,200);
	s2 = new Spring(mc,b2,50,5,1,200);
	
	b1.registerForce(g); //register gravity
	b1.registerForce(s1); //register spring
	b2.registerForce(s2);
	b2.registerForce(g); 
	
	p = new Physics();
	p.registerBall(b1);
	p.registerBall(b2);
	
	r = new Render(c);
	r.registerBall(b1);
	r.registerBall(b2);
	
	l = new Logic();
	l.setRender(r);
	l.setPhysics(p);
	l.run();

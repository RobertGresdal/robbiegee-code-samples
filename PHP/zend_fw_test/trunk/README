1. Remember to download Zend Framework and Doctrine. Unzip the 
   Zend Framework and look somewhere inside it to find the Zend 
   folder. Copy it to the "library" folder here. Then find 
   "Doctrine.php" and the "Doctrine" folder and add those too.

2. Set up a VirtualHost and point your root to the "public" 
   folder.

3. Run the data/db/schema/generate-db.php to create the database and
   classes so we can access them.

4. If you are hosting locally and pointed the root correctly, you 
   should now be able to access http://localhost/ and see the welcome
   screen.
